### Tools to analyze the Joinmarket orderbook snapshots

In my master thesis, I focus on the [Joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver) coinjoin protocol. Part of the thesis consist of getting the raw data from the public orderbook.
This tool contains the python code to parse the data and create visualizations that can answer questions such as what is the liquidity of Joinmarket at a given point in time or what is the lifetime of the makers offers.
